Topic aware Response Generation in Conversational Systems. We use a approach that utilises Sequence to Sequence RNN Encoder Decoder with NMF based topic modelling.
Not so long ago, Idea of human like conversational system seemed elusive. But recent
development in Deep Neural Networks and availability of large conversational data has
increased the prospects of such models that can communicate in human way. Behind
the advancement of deep learning algorithms in various areas like language modeling
lies several factors. Some of them are availability of the vast quantities of conversational
exchanges and advancement in computing power and computation techniques.
Some of drawbacks of deep neural networks is that their feature representations are
hard to interpret. On other hand topic models like NMF, combine data modelling and
optimization to develop interpretable and consistent feature structures in data. We are
considering to add topic information in Neural Network framework to generate informative
and interesting responses for conversational systems. Our model will use topic
information being leveraged as prior knowledge in response generation
